They work well together, dedicating themselves to their tribes and often serving powerful creatures they revere as worthy leaders. Despite their small stature and fragile bodies, kobolds are incredibly resourceful and dangerous when coordinating their efforts.\n\n**Physical Description**: Kobolds are small reptilian humanoids with scaled skin that ranges from rust-red to deep cobalt blue. They have pointed ears, draconic snouts, and thin tails. Most stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, with lean, wiry builds.\n\n**Society**: Kobold society is highly communal and hierarchical. They organize themselves into tribes that often serve dragons or other powerful creatures. Kobolds excel at trap-making, ambush tactics, and working together to overcome challenges that would defeat them individually.\n\n**Alignment and Religion**: Kobolds tend toward lawful alignments due to their structured societies. Many worship dragons or dragon gods, particularly Apsu and Dahak, depending on their tribe's philosophy.\n\n**Adventurers**: Kobold adventurers often leave their tribes to prove themselves worthy, seek knowledge to benefit their clan, or flee persecution. They make excellent rogues, alchemists, and sorcerers, using their cunning to overcome their physical limitations.\n\n**Names**: Kobold names are sharp and often include hard consonants. Examples include Draakku, Irnk, Korka, Maksa, Tinzo, Ukaza, Yassa, and Zekka.\n",

They often live in tight-knit communities in wetlands and jungles, valuing strength, survival skills, and respect for the natural world.\n\n**Physical Description**: Iruxi are tall, powerfully built reptilian humanoids standing 6 to 7 feet tall. They have scaled skin in shades of green, brown, gray, or rust-red, powerful tails for balance, and sharp teeth. Their eyes are often yellow or orange with vertical pupils.\n\n**Society**: Lizardfolk society revolves around survival and community strength. They organize into clans led by the strongest and wisest members. Iruxi value practical skills, with even their artisans and shamans expected to contribute to hunting and defense. They live in harmony with their environment, viewing themselves as part of nature rather than separate from it.\n\n**Alignment and Religion**: Most lizardfolk are neutral, focused on the practical needs of survival and community. They often worship nature spirits, dragon gods, or deities associated with strength and survival. Many follow the tenets of the lizardfolk deity Sgothgah.\n\n**Adventurers**: Lizardfolk adventurers often leave their communities to gain experience and strength to bring back to their clan, or to defend their homelands from external threats. They make formidable barbarians, druids, and rangers, with natural aptitude for survival in harsh environments.\n\n**Names**: Iruxi names often have a hissing or guttural quality. Examples include Arasheg, Essaru, Enshuk, Gishkim, Hazi, Inishish, Kutak, Nasha, Shulkuru, Tarka, and Ushketh.\n",

They possess an uncanny knack for tinkering and can squeeze through spaces that would stymie larger folk.\n\n**Physical Description**: Ysoki stand about 4 feet tall with lean, wiry frames. They have pointed snouts, round ears, and hairless tails that can be as long as their bodies. Their fur varies widely in color, from white to brown to black, often with mottled patterns.\n\n**Society**: Ratfolk society centers around large family groups and trading networks that span continents. They excel as merchants, tinkers, and inventors, and their warrens are marvels of efficient engineering with tunnels connecting every important location.\n\n**Alignment and Religion**: Most ratfolk are neutral, concerned primarily with the prosperity of their families and communities. They commonly worship Lao Geung, a ratfolk deity of prosperity and community, though many also follow other gods of trade and crafting.\n\n**Adventurers**: Ysoki take to adventuring naturally, seeing it as an opportunity to expand their trading networks, gather rare materials, or help their communities. They make excellent inventors, rogues, and alchemists, using their natural dexterity and intellect.\n\n**Names**: Ysoki names often have a squeaky or chittering quality. Examples include Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Drannic, Jinkis, Korvi, Malara, Nikit, Queck, Tikkit, and Witani.\n",

They are known for their natural curiosity, collecting habits, and surprising adaptability. Tengu have integrated themselves into many societies across the world while maintaining their unique cultural identity.\n\n**Physical Description**: Tengu are medium-sized humanoids with distinctly corvid features, including beaks, talons for hands and feet, and feathers covering their bodies. Their plumage ranges from glossy black to browns, grays, and even occasional bright colors. They stand between 5 and 6 feet tall with slight but athletic builds.\n\n**Society**: Tengu society values individuality, curiosity, and the sharing of stories and knowledge. They are natural wanderers and collectors, often accumulating odd trinkets and bits of lore. Traditional tengu communities encourage their members to travel widely and return with tales of their adventures.\n\n**Alignment and Religion**: Tengu lean toward chaotic alignments, valuing freedom and adaptability. They worship a variety of deities but show particular reverence to Hei Feng, a god of the sea, storms, and wanderers, as well as gods of travel, knowledge, and freedom.\n\n**Adventurers**: Tengu take to adventuring naturally, driven by curiosity and wanderlust. They make excellent rogues, fighters, and bards, often excelling at swordplay and storytelling. Their adaptability allows them to fit into most adventuring roles.\n\n**Names**: Tengu names often have a sharp, clicking quality reflecting their beaked speech. Examples include Arhan, Chuko, Gragchu, Kachka, Kunkoro, Maksuko, Nakai, Rei, Shipori, Tak, and Zanko.\n",
