### Completed Work - Sprint 3 Phase 2

#### ✅ useCharacterBuilder.ts (COMPLETE)
**Location**: `apps/web/src/hooks/useCharacterBuilder.ts`

**Changes Applied**:
1. Added `updateEquipment` method to BuilderHookResult interface
2. Implemented updateEquipment callback with state management
3. Exported updateEquipment in hook return

**Code Added**:
```typescript
// In BuilderHookResult interface (~line 62)
interface BuilderHookResult {
  // ... existing methods
  updateEquipment: (equipment: any[], wealthRemaining: number) => void;
}

// Implementation (~lines 572-592)
const updateEquipment = useCallback((equipment: any[], wealthRemaining: number) => {
  let nextCharacter: Character | null = null;

  setState((current) => {
    if (!current) return current;

    const { character } = current;

    const updatedCharacter = {
      ...character,
      equipment,
    };

    nextCharacter = updatedCharacter;
    return { ...current, character: updatedCharacter };
  });

  if (nextCharacter) {
    persistCharacterState(nextCharacter);
  }
}, []);

// In return statement (~line 623)
return {
  // ... existing exports
  updateEquipment,
};
```

#### ✅ WizardViewport.tsx (COMPLETE)

#### ✅ CreationWizard.tsx (COMPLETE)

### Archived: Previous Remaining Work Instructions

#### WizardViewport.tsx (ARCHIVED - COMPLETED)
**Location**: `apps/web/src/components/creation/WizardViewport.tsx`

**Required Changes** (4 updates):

**1. Add Import** (add near line 15 with other component imports):
```typescript
import { EquipmentSelector } from "./EquipmentSelector";
```

**2. Add Prop to Interface** (add to WizardViewportProps interface, ~line 32):
```typescript
interface WizardViewportProps {
  // ... existing props
  onFeatSelectionChange: (selections: Array<{ slotIndex: number; featId: string; grantedBy: string }>) => void;
  onEquipmentChange: (equipment: any[], wealthRemaining: number) => void;  // ADD THIS
}
```

**3. Destructure Prop** (add to destructuring, ~line 58):
```typescript
export function WizardViewport({
  catalog,
  character,
  pendingChoices,
  currentStep,
  onStepChange,
  onEntitySelect,
  onAbilityBoostResolve,
  onFeatSelectionChange,
  onEquipmentChange,  // ADD THIS
}: WizardViewportProps): JSX.Element {
```

**4. Replace Equipment Rendering** (find the equipment step rendering, ~line 142):

**Find this code**:
```typescript
{currentStep === 7 && (
  <div>
    <h2>Equipment & Wealth</h2>
    <p>Starting wealth: 15 gp. Purchase your initial equipment.</p>
    <p style={{ color: "#888" }}>(Equipment selector placeholder)</p>
  </div>
)}
```

**Replace with**:
```typescript
{currentStep === 7 && (
  <div>
    <h2 style={{ color: "#daa520", fontSize: "1.5rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>Equipment & Wealth</h2>
    <p style={{ color: "#ccc", marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
      You begin with <strong>15 gp</strong> to purchase your starting equipment. Choose weapons, armor, and adventuring gear.
    </p>
    <EquipmentSelector
      catalog={catalog}
      strengthModifier={Math.floor((character.abilities.str - 10) / 2)}
      onEquipmentChange={onEquipmentChange}
    />
  </div>
)}
```

#### CreationWizard.tsx (ARCHIVED - COMPLETED)
**Location**: `apps/web/src/components/creation/CreationWizard.tsx`

**Required Changes** (2 updates):

**1. Destructure updateEquipment** (find the useCharacterBuilder call, add to destructuring):

**Find this code**:
```typescript
const {
  character,
  pendingChoices,
  selectAncestry,
  selectBackground,
  selectClass,
  resolveAbilityBoost,
  selectFeats,
  resetCharacter,
} = useCharacterBuilder(catalog);
```

**Update to**:
```typescript
const {
  character,
  pendingChoices,
  selectAncestry,
  selectBackground,
  selectClass,
  resolveAbilityBoost,
  selectFeats,
  updateEquipment,  // ADD THIS
  resetCharacter,
} = useCharacterBuilder(catalog);
```

**2. Pass Handler to WizardViewport** (find the WizardViewport component usage):

**Find this code**:
```typescript
<WizardViewport
  catalog={catalog}
  character={character}
  pendingChoices={pendingChoices}
  currentStep={currentStep}
  onStepChange={setCurrentStep}
  onEntitySelect={handleEntitySelect}
  onAbilityBoostResolve={resolveAbilityBoost}
  onFeatSelectionChange={handleFeatSelectionChange}
/>
```

**Update to**:
```typescript
<WizardViewport
  catalog={catalog}
  character={character}
  pendingChoices={pendingChoices}
  currentStep={currentStep}
  onStepChange={setCurrentStep}
  onEntitySelect={handleEntitySelect}
  onAbilityBoostResolve={resolveAbilityBoost}
  onFeatSelectionChange={handleFeatSelectionChange}
  onEquipmentChange={updateEquipment}  // ADD THIS
/>
```

## Project Architecture Notes

### Character State Management
- **Hook**: `useCharacterBuilder.ts` - Central state management for character creation
- **Persistence**: `persistCharacterState()` - Saves to localStorage after each change
- **Viewport**: `WizardViewport.tsx` - Renders step-by-step wizard UI
- **Controller**: `CreationWizard.tsx` - Orchestrates wizard flow and state updates

### Equipment System Design
- **Currency**: All prices normalized to copper pieces (1 gp = 100 cp, 1 sp = 10 cp)
- **Bulk**: Calculated per PF2e rules, rounded down to nearest integer
- **Encumbrance**: Two thresholds (5+STR encumbered, 10+STR max)
- **Catalog Integration**: Equipment loaded from YAML files via catalog entity system

---

## Development Environment

- **Workspace**: Monorepo with pnpm + Turborepo
- **Packages**:
  - `@pen-paper-rpg/catalog` - Content loading and validation
  - `@pen-paper-rpg/engine` - Rules engine and calculations
  - `@pen-paper-rpg/schemas` - Zod validation schemas
- **Apps**:
  - `apps/web` - Next.js 14 App Router (character creator UI)
  - `apps/desktop` - Electron wrapper (future)

### Content Pipeline
1. Create YAML files in `packs/core/items/`
2. Run `npm run catalog:build` to validate and index
3. Catalog available at runtime via `CatalogIndex`
4. Components filter/display catalog entities
