## Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Content Source**: Should we focus on Core Rulebook only, or expand to all sourcebooks?
2. **Homebrew Support**: Should we support custom content creation by users?
3. **Cloud Sync**: Should characters sync across devices?
4. **Monetization**: Free/open-source vs. premium features?
5. **VTT Integration**: Priority for Foundry, Roll20, or Fantasy Grounds?
6. **AI Features**: Should we add AI character suggestions or backstory generation?
