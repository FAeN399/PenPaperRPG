  This parchment scroll contains a single casting of the heal spell.

  Usage: held in 1 hand

  Activate: Cast a Spell

  Activating a scroll requires Casting the Spell at the spell's rank. You must have the spell on your spell list to activate the scroll. If you do, you can cast it even if you don't have spell slots remaining or if the spell isn't prepared.

  Casting a spell from a scroll requires material, somatic, and verbal components. The scroll is destroyed after being activated. You can use a scroll even if the spell is of a higher rank than you can normally cast, but you must succeed at a counteract check to do so.

  This scroll casts heal at 1st rank, restoring 1d8 Hit Points to a living creature within 30 feet. If you have fewer than maximum Hit Points and cast heal targeting yourself, you restore an additional 1d8 Hit Points.
