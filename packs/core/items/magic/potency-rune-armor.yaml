  Magical enhancements make this armor more effective. A potency rune is what makes armor magic armor.

  Usage: etched onto armor

  An item can have only one fundamental rune of each type, though it can have any number of property runes. A +1 armor potency rune grants a +1 item bonus to AC. If you're wearing armor without a potency rune, you can upgrade it by etching a potency rune on it with the Craft activity.
