summary: Bracers that grant a +1 item bonus to AC when unarmored.
description: |
  These stiff leather bracers are embossed with mystical symbols and grant you power to deflect blows.

  Usage: worn bracers
  Bulk: L

  These bracers grant you a +1 item bonus to AC if you're not wearing armor. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels (to a maximum of +3 at 15th level). If you're wearing armor, you gain no benefit from the bracers, but you can still etch fundamental and property runes onto them as normal for bracers.
