summary: A bolt that affixes itself to a surface and creates a rope.
description: |
  This steel bolt is etched with transmutation runes and has a thick eyelet at its base.

  Usage: held in 1 hand
  Bulk: L
  Activate: Interact

  You toss the bolt at a surface within 60 feet. It flies directly to the target location and affixes itself with a loud click. It can support up to 4,000 pounds of weight. Once the bolt is affixed, a 60-foot-long rope appears, hanging from the bolt's eyelet. The rope is the same strength and has the same statistics as a typical adventuring rope. Both the bolt and rope last for 8 hours, after which they disappear.
