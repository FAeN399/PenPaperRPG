summary: A fundamental rune that increases weapon damage dice.
description: |
  A striking rune stores extra magical power in your weapon, increasing the weapon damage dice it deals to two instead of one.

  Usage: etched onto a weapon

  A striking rune etched onto a weapon increases the number of weapon damage dice it deals to two. For instance, a +1 striking dagger would deal 2d4 damage instead of 1d4 damage.

  This benefit doesn't apply to other dice a weapon adds, such as precision damage, versatile damage, or a fatal die increase. A weapon can have only one striking rune at a time.
