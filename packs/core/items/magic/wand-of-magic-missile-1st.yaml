description: |
  This wand is carved from rowan wood and tipped with a gleaming crystal that glows with arcane energy.

  Usage: held in 1 hand
  Bulk: L
  Activate: Cast a Spell
  Frequency: once per day, plus overcharge

  You cast magic missile at 1st rank. The spell fires three missiles that each deal 1d4+1 force damage to a target of your choice within 120 feet.

  Overcharge: You can attempt to overcharge the wand by activating it even if you've already done so that day. This requires a DC 10 flat check. On a success, you cast the spell normally. On a failure, the spell is not cast, the charge is wasted, and you can't activate the wand again until your next daily preparations.
