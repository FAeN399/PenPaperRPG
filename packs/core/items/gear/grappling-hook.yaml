summary: A multi-pronged hook for climbing.
description: |
  You can throw a grappling hook with a rope tied to it to make a climb easier. To anchor a grappling hook, make an attack roll with the secret trait against a DC depending on the target, typically DC 20 for a battleground object and DC 25 for a ledge or structure. On a success, your hook has a firm hold, but on a critical failure, the hook seems like it will hold but actually falls when you're partway up.
