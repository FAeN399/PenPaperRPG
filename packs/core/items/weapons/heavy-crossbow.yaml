description: |
  A large, powerful crossbow that fires heavy bolts with tremendous force. The heavy crossbow sacrifices rate of fire for damage and range.

  - Damage: 1d10 piercing
  - Hands: 2
  - Group: Bow
  - Weapon Traits: range 120 ft., reload 2

  The heavy crossbow deals excellent damage and has superior range, making it ideal for sniping. However, reload 2 means you must use two Interact actions to reload it, significantly limiting your rate of fire.
