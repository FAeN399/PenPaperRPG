summary: >
  Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful attacks to defeat your enemies. Your rages draw upon a vicious instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most.
