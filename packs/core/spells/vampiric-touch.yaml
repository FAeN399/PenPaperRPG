summary: Your touch deals void damage and heals you.
description: |
  Your touch leeches the lifeblood out of a target to empower yourself. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a success, you deal 6d6 void damage and the target becomes drained 1. On a critical success, the target becomes drained 2 instead. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the void damage the target takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.
