summary: You unravel the magic of a spell or item.
description: |
  You unravel the magic of a spell or magic item, potentially causing it to end or be suppressed. Choose a spell effect or magic item within range and attempt a counteract check against it. If you succeed, the spell ends (if it's 2nd rank or lower) or is suppressed for 1 round (if it's higher than 2nd rank). If you target a magic item, it's suppressed for 1 round on a success, and you can't target the same item again for 10 minutes.
