  Blessings from beyond help your companions strike true. You and your allies in the area gain a +1 status bonus to attack rolls. Once per turn, starting the turn after you cast bless, you can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to increase the emanation's radius by 5 feet and force enemies in the area to attempt Will saves. On a failure, they take a -1 status penalty to attack rolls for 1 round.
