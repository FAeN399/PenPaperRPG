description: |
  A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must succeed at a Reflex save or take 3d6 fire damage.

  On subsequent rounds, you can Sustain the spell to move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you move the sphere into a creature's space, that creature must attempt the save against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving. You can't move the sphere into a space occupied by a creature unless you want it to stop there.
