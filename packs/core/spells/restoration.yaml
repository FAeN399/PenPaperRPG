description: |
  Restorative magic counters the effects of toxins or conditions that prevent a creature from functioning at its best. When you cast restoration, choose to either reduce a condition or lessen the effect of a toxin. A creature can benefit from only one restoration spell each day, and it can't benefit from restoration more than once to reduce the stage of the same exposure to a given toxin.

  Reduce a Condition: Reduce the value of the target's clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied condition by 2. You can instead reduce two of the listed conditions by 1 each.

  Lessen a Toxin: Reduce the stage of one toxin the target suffers from by one stage. This can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the affliction.
