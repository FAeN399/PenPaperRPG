  You channel void energy to harm the living or heal the undead. If the target is a living creature, you deal 1d8 void damage to it, and it gets a basic Fortitude save. If the target is a willing undead creature, you restore that amount of Hit Points. The number of actions you spend when Casting this Spell determines its targets, range, area, and other parameters.

  1 action (somatic): The spell has a range of touch.
  2 actions (somatic, verbal): The spell has a range of 30 feet. If you're dealing damage, increase the damage by 8.
  3 actions (material, somatic, verbal): You disperse void energy in a 30-foot emanation. This targets all living and undead creatures in the area.
