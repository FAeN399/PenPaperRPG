summary: Transform your hand into a deadly claw and attack with it.
description: |
  You temporarily morph your limb into a clawed appendage. Make a melee spell attack roll against your target's AC. Your claw is in the brawling weapon group and has the agile and finesse traits.

  **Critical Success** The target takes 2d6 slashing damage and takes a â€“5-foot status penalty to its Speed for 1 round.
  **Success** The target takes 1d6 slashing damage.

  The spell ends when you use an action that doesn't have the attack trait. If you Cast this Spell again, any previous casting automatically ends.

  **Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6 on a success (or 2d6 on a critical success).
