description: |
  The target is overtaken with uncontrollable laughter. It must attempt a Will save.

  Critical Success: The target is unaffected.

  Success: The target is slowed 1 for 1 round.

  Failure: The target is slowed 1 and can't use reactions for 1 round. It must attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns; this ongoing save has the incapacitation trait. On a failure, the target is slowed 1 for that turn, and on a second consecutive failure on these saves, the spell ends. On a success, the slowed condition ends, but the target can't use reactions for that turn. On a critical success, the spell ends, and the target can use reactions normally.

  Critical Failure: The target falls prone and can't use actions or reactions for 1 round. It then follows the failure effects.
