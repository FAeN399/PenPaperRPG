summary: Three illusory duplicates protect you from attacks.
description: |
  Three illusory images of you swirl about your space, moving with you and mimicking your actions. Each time you're hit by a Strike, roll 1d4. On a 1, the attack hits you. On a 2, 3, or 4, you're unaffected, and one of your images is destroyed. Once all images are gone, the spell ends.
