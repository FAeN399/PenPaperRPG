description: >
  The power of winter flows through you. This heritage is most common among the Jadwiga of Irrisen, due to their
  descent from Baba Yaga, and certain Erutaki touched by the spirits. You gain cold resistance equal to half
  your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme.
