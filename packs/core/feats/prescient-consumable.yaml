  Requirements: You haven't used this ability since the last time you were able to purchase goods.

  As Prescient Planner, but you can pull out any common consumable item with a level of half your level or less. The consumable must still be one you could have purchased, meaning you must be at a location where you can purchase items, or must have earned income to purchase items during downtime.
