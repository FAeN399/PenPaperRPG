description: >
  Your legacy grants you great destructive power. When you Cast a Spell from your spell slots, if the spell
  deals damage and doesn't have a duration, you gain a status bonus to that spell's damage equal to the spell's
  rank. This applies only to spells that don't have a duration and that you cast using spell slots.
