description: 'Your catlike aerial acrobatics allow you to cushion your falls. Treat
  falls as 10 feet shorter. If you''re an expert in Acrobatics, treat falls as 25
  feet shorter. If you''re a master in Acrobatics, treat them as 50 feet shorter.
  If you''re legendary in Acrobatics, you always land on your feet and don''t take
  damage, regardless of the distance of the fall.
