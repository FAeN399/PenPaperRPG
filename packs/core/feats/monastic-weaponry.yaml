description: >
  You have trained with weapons as an extension of your body. You become trained in simple weapons and martial
  weapons with the monk trait. When your proficiency rank for unarmed attacks increases to expert or master,
  your proficiency rank for these weapons increases to expert or master as well. You can use melee monk weapons
  with any of your monk feats or monk abilities that normally require unarmed attacks.
