summary: Fierceness in battle runs through your blood, allowing you to avoid death.
description: Fierceness in battle runs through your blood, and you refuse to fall
  from your injuries. You gain the Orc Ferocity reaction. You can use Orc Ferocity
  when you would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not immediately killed. You avoid
  being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, and your wounded condition increases
  by 1. You can't use this ability if your wounded value is 3 or higher.
