summary: Through study or exposure to different magical traditions, you've learned
  a cantrip from a different tradition.
description: Through study of multiple magical traditions, or via exposure to different
  traditions through your culture, you've learned a cantrip from a tradition other
  than your own. Choose a cantrip from the spell list of a magical tradition other
  than your own. If you have a spell repertoire or a spellbook, replace one of the
  cantrips you know or have in your spellbook with the chosen spell. If you prepare
  spells without a spellbook, replace one of your prepared cantrips with the chosen
  cantrip.
