summary: Your confidence borders on arrogance, granting you a bonus to resist mental
  effects.
description: Your unshakeable confidence in yourself and your abilities makes it harder
  for others to sway your mind. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws
  against mental effects. When you roll a success on a saving throw against a mental
  effect, you get a critical success instead.
