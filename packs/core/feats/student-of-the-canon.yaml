  You've spent considerable time studying a specific religious or philosophical text and can invoke its teachings in everyday life. Choose a text. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Diplomacy, Lore, and Society checks to interact with people who also study the same text. If you critically fail a check to Recall Knowledge about the subject matter of your chosen text, you get a failure instead. Finally, you can attempt to Recall Knowledge about that text using Society or your Lore skill for the text's origin.
