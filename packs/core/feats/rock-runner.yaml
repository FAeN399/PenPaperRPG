summary: Your innate connection to stone makes you adept at moving across uneven surfaces.
description: Your innate connection to stone makes you adept at moving across uneven
  surfaces. You can ignore difficult terrain caused by rubble and uneven ground made
  of stone and earth. In addition, when you use the Acrobatics skill to Balance on
  narrow surfaces or uneven ground made of stone or earth, you aren't off-guard, and
  when you roll a success at one of these Acrobatics checks, you get a critical success
  instead.
