description: 'You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your
  Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you have concealed,
  the GM uses the number rolled or 10 + your Stealth modifier, whichever is higher,
  as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine
  your Stealth check result. If you''re a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number
  rolled or 15 + your Stealth modifier, whichever is higher. If you''re legendary
  in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive
  observers.
