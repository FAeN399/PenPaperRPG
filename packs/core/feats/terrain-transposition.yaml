  Requirements: You are in difficult terrain.

  You leap up and over an adjacent willing ally, swapping positions with that ally. You must end this movement in a space that is adjacent to the position you started in. Both you and your ally must occupy spaces of the same size. This movement doesn't trigger reactions.
