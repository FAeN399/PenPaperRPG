description: 'You were raised among the nobility or have learned proper etiquette
  and bearing, allowing you to present yourself as a noble and play games of influence
  and politics. You can use Society to Make an Impression on a noble, as well as with
  Impersonate to pretend to be a noble if you aren''t one. If you want to impersonate
  a specific noble, you still need to use Deception to Impersonate normally, and to
  Lie when necessary.
