description: >
  You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. You gain a +1
  circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to
  saves against traps. Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require
  you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.
