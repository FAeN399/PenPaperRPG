description: >
  You make a pact with a creature that serves you and assists your spellcasting. You gain a familiar, an animal
  that aids you in your magical studies. The type of animal is up to you, but most sorcerers choose one that
  matches their bloodline. Your familiar acts on your turn and can use 2 actions during your turn.
