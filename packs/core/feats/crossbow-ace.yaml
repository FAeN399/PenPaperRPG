description: >
  You are a skilled crossbow user, able to load and fire with incredible speed. You can use a hand crossbow
  or light crossbow with one hand, even if it doesn't have the free-hand trait. When you're wielding a
  crossbow and use Hunt Prey or use Interact to reload your crossbow, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to
  the damage roll on your next Strike with that crossbow. If the crossbow you're wielding has the backstabber
  trait and you have the precision ranger edge, this also applies to your additional precision damage from
  your edge.
