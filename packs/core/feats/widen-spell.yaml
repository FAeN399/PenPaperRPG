description: >
  You manipulate the energy of your spell to affect a wider area. If the next action you use is to Cast a
  Spell that has an area of a burst, cone, or line and does not have a duration, increase the area of that
  spell. Add 5 feet to the radius of a burst that normally has a radius of at least 10 feet (a burst with
  a smaller radius is not affected). Add 5 feet to the length of a cone or line that is normally 15 feet
  long or smaller, and add 10 feet to the length of a larger cone or line.
