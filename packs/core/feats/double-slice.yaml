description: >
  You lash out at your foe with both weapons. Make two Strikes, one with each of your two melee weapons,
  each using your current multiple attack penalty. Both Strikes must have the same target. If the second
  Strike is made with a weapon that doesn't have the agile trait, it takes a -2 penalty. If both attacks
  hit, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses.
