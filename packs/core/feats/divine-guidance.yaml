  You pray to your deity or pantheon for divine guidance in a moment of need. Make a DC 5 flat check. On a success, you receive a +1 circumstance bonus to one attack roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check you make before the start of your next turn. On a failure, you receive no benefit but can still use this feat again later in the same day.
