description: 'Your training focused on crafting a particular kind of item. Select
  one of the specialties listed below; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Crafting
  checks to Craft items of that type. If you''re a master in Crafting, this bonus
  increases to +2. If it''s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides.
  Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar
  and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because
  the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking. Specialties include: alchemy,
  artistry, blacksmithing, bookmaking, glassmaking, leatherworking, pottery, shipbuilding,
  stonemasonry, tailoring, and woodworking.
