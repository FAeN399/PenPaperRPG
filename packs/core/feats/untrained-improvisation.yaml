description: |
  You've learned how to handle situations when you're out of your depth. You can attempt skill actions requiring you to be trained, even if you are untrained. When attempting a skill check with a skill you're untrained in, your proficiency bonus is equal to your level instead of 0. You can add your proficiency bonus for the skill only if you have a feature that allows you to add your proficiency bonus for untrained skills. If you roll a critical failure on a skill check for a skill you're untrained in, it's instead a failure.
