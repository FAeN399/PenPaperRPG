summary: You can tap into your ancestral memories to gain training in a skill each
  day.
description: You have accumulated knowledge over several lifetimes. During your daily
  preparations, you can reflect on your life experiences to gain the trained proficiency
  rank in one skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again.
  Since this proficiency is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a skill
  increase or a permanent character option.
