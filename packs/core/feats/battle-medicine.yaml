description: 'You can patch up wounds, even in combat. Attempt a Medicine check with
  the same DC as for Treat Wounds and restore the corresponding amount of Hit Points;
  this does not remove the wounded condition. As with Treat Wounds, you can attempt
  checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum proficiency rank. The target is
  then temporarily immune to your Battle Medicine for 1 day.
