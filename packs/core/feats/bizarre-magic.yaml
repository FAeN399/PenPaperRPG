  You must have the ability to cast spells.

  You can make your spells harder to identify. Whenever you cast a spell, other creatures must succeed at a DC 5 flat check to identify your spells with Recognize Spell; on a failure, they misidentify it as another spell of your choice that has the same school and is the same or lower rank. You can choose a different spell for each creature that attempts to Recognize your Spell.
