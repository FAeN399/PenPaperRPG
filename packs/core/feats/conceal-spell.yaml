description: |
  You must have the ability to cast spells.

  Hiding your gestures and incantations, you attempt to conceal the fact that you are casting a spell. If the next action you take is to Cast a Spell, attempt a Stealth check against one or more observers' Perception DCs; if the spell has verbal components, you must also attempt a Deception check against the observers' Perception DC. If you succeed at your check (or checks) against an observer's DC, that observer doesn't notice you're casting a spell, even though the spell's effects are still obvious.
