  You embody an aspect of your deity. Choose one of your deity's domains. You gain the domain's initial domain
  spell as a devotion spell. If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you
  can Refocus by praying to your deity or performing service toward their causes. You are trained in the skill
  associated with that domain.
